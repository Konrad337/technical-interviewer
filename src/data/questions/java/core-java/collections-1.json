Unlike explicit sorting operations, these collections ensure elements remain sorted after each insertion or removal, making them ideal when you need a continuously-sorted collection rather than a one-time sort."

This method uses different algorithms depending on the array type and size: insertion sort for small arrays of primitive types, mergesort for object arrays, and dual-pivot quicksort for larger primitive arrays in recent JDK versions."

This method uses a parallel implementation of mergesort that divides the array into regions sorted in parallel, then merges the results. It provides significant performance benefits for large arrays on systems with multiple CPU cores."

For large lists, consider the memory implications of sorting or use specialized structures like **PriorityQueue** for partial sorting. The stability guarantee ensures that equal elements maintain their relative order after sorting, which can be important for multi-pass sorting algorithms or maintaining secondary ordering criteria."

This method provides the same functionality as Collections.sort() but with a more object-oriented syntax. For example, instead of `Collections.sort(myList, comparator)`, you can write `myList.sort(comparator)`. For null comparators, it defaults to natural ordering using Comparable."
