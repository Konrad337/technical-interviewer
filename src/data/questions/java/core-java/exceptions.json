Modern Java practices tend to favor unchecked exceptions for most cases to reduce boilerplate code, with libraries like Spring primarily using unchecked exceptions.

For performance-critical code, consider alternatives to exceptions for normal control flow or expected conditions. Creating an exception is much more expensive than regular control flow due to capturing the stack trace (approximately 1-10μs vs 1-10ns for a method call). This overhead is most significant when exceptions are thrown frequently, so design APIs to minimize exception creation in hot paths."
